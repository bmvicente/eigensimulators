            A couple of assumptions were made in our Simulator to simplify and more easily illustrate the potential reward emission of an AVS in a Dual Staking and LST Restaking context:

            **Dual Staking** was chosen as the business model, preferred over other models, due to the utility and security they confer to an AVS, and **Veto Dual Staking**, as the Dual Staking method, preferred over other methods, due to the low implementation cost and reliability in terms of liveness. [Learn more](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/dual-staking/)

            **LST Restaking** was chosen as the Restaking Modality because the Dual Staking model requires a staked ETH of some kind, and also because it was simpler and more intuitive, compared to other modalities. [Learn more](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/readme/whitepaper)

            Generally speaking, these three assumptions were made due to the safety they confer AVSs, especially recent ones, and for simplicity's sake in a first version of the Simulator.
                    
            We recommend the AVS Risk Simulator as an important introduction to understanding the AVS Reward Emission Simulator.

                The AVS Reward Emission percentage from the AVS Revenue input range fell in the XX% value.

                Operator Reward is naturally being given greater weight than the Staker Reward due to their more important role.

                The \$AVSâ€™s Tokenomics (while not included in the reward calculation) suggest a look-ahead perspective of how the native AVS token can influence future rewards. A potential for improved rewards to be emitted in the future exists if a relatively small delta between circulating and total supply and a deflationary token rate exist. Whereas a larger delta and an inflationary token rate indicate the potential for lower rewards to be emitted in the future.
