            A couple of assumptions were made in our Simulator to simplify and more easily illustrate the potential reward emission of an AVS in a Dual Staking and LST Restaking context:

            **Dual Staking** was chosen as the business model, preferred over other models, due to the utility and security they confer to an AVS, and **Veto Dual Staking**, as the Dual Staking method, preferred over other methods, due to the low implementation cost and reliability in terms of liveness.

            **LST Restaking** was chosen as the Restaking Modality because the Dual Staking model requires a staked ETH of some kind, and also because it was simpler and more intuitive, compared to other modalities. [Learn more](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/readme/whitepaper)

            Generally speaking, these three assumptions were made due to the safety they confer AVSs, especially recent ones, and for simplicity's sake in a first version of the Simulator.
                    
            We recommend the AVS Risk Simulator as an important introduction to understanding the AVS Reward Emission Simulator.
