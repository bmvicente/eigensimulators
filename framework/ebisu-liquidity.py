### need to figure out how much liquidity do we need relative to collateral deposited & 
### ebUSD minted (probs taking into consideration how much leverage is in the system too so we can proccess liquidations)

                weETH is a liquid staking derivative (LSD) representing staked Ether (ETH) within the EtherFi protocol. 
                Its architecture combines Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake rewards mechanism with a non-custodial staking model, 
                ensuring that users retain full ownership of their staked assets while delegating validation rights. 
                This design mitigates centralization risks and enables the distribution of staking rewards via rebasing, 
                where the token‚Äôs value increases to reflect accrued rewards. Additionally, EtherFi‚Äôs decentralized node operator 
                framework enhances trust by reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries. The token‚Äôs value is inherently tied to 
                Ethereum‚Äôs price and staking yield, making it highly desirable for capital-efficient DeFi strategies.

                For stakers, weETH offers liquidity for otherwise locked ETH while capturing staking rewards, including MEV 
                (Maximal Extractable Value). For lenders and borrowers, it provides an income-generating, high-quality collateral 
                asset with dual utility: liquidity and yield generation. However, the volatility of ETH‚Äôs price, coupled with potential 
                slashing risks, necessitates cautious collateralization settings. A Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR) of 150% 
                is advised to protect against sharp price swings, while interest rates for loans secured by weETH should be set between 
                5-7%, adequately compensating lenders for the associated risks.

                sUSDe is a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and supported by over-collateralized reserves 
                or algorithmic stability mechanisms. Its architecture uses a combination of collateral ratios, arbitrage opportunities, 
                and market-driven incentives to maintain peg stability. The token‚Äôs design allows users to mint or redeem sUSDe based on 
                collateral fluctuations, encouraging arbitrageurs to restore the peg during deviations. Unlike traditional stablecoins, 
                sUSDe can also offer staking rewards, incentivizing users to lock the token within the protocol while preserving its liquidity 
                for borrowing and trading activities.

                For stakers, sUSDe provides low-risk, stable returns with minimal exposure to price volatility, appealing to risk-averse participants. 
                For lenders and borrowers, its predictability simplifies debt management and reduces liquidation risks, making it a reliable collateral 
                option for leveraged DeFi positions. Due to its low volatility, an MCR of 110% balances safety with capital efficiency, while interest 
                rates for loans can be set between 2-3%, reflecting its reduced risk profile and stable value proposition.

                merges Bitcoin‚Äôs store-of-value utility with Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract capabilities, allowing LBTC holders to participate in lending, 
                staking, and liquidity provisioning without relinquishing their Bitcoin exposure. Its interoperability and underlying trust in Bitcoin‚Äôs

                #### **Collateralization and Stability**
                The **Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR)**, set at **{token_results['MCR (%)']:.2f}%**, serves as a benchmark to mitigate liquidation risks by ensuring adequate collateral backing. 
                While higher MCR values reduce the likelihood of system instability, they can also constrain capital efficiency, requiring users to lock up more collateral than might be operationally optimal.
                
                **Total Deposits** in the system amount to **\${token_results['Deposits (USD)']:,.2f}**, with collateral value post-price variation calculated at **\${token_results['Collateral Value After Price Variation (USD)']:,.2f}**. 
                These figures reflect the current level of collateral robustness, but their adequacy depends on market conditions and collateral performance. For synthetic stablecoins like sUSDe, maintaining a stable peg is crucial as de-pegging risks could undermine the entire system. 
                Collateral types such as weETH, which represent staked assets, bring additional complexities like slashing risks or withdrawal delays, necessitating more dynamic MCR adjustments to address these token-specific challenges.

                #### **Leverage and Minting Dynamics**
                The system‚Äôs leverage dynamics are calibrated to strike a balance between efficiency and risk. A **Maximum Leverage Loop** of **{token_results['Max Leverage Loops (x)']:.2f}x** indicates the potential extent of collateral re-use while maintaining adequate risk controls.
                
                With a total of **\${token_results['ebUSD Minted (USD)']:,.2f}** in **minted ebUSD** and an overall **Debt After Leveraging** of **\${token_results['Total Debt After Leverage (USD)']:,.2f}**, the system exhibits significant exposure that warrants careful monitoring. 
                High utilization rates, while indicative of demand, can also amplify liquidity constraints and systemic fragility, particularly for assets like weETH where staking yield and liquidity delays introduce additional risks.

                #### **Risk Assessment**
                - **Debt-to-Collateral Ratio (DCR)**: The DCR, currently at **{token_results['Debt-to-Collateral Ratio']:.2f}**, measures total debt relative to collateral. Ratios above 1.5 can signal heightened risks, as collateral might not suffice to cover debt obligations during adverse market movements. Interest rates can be dynamically adjusted upwards as the DCR nears this threshold to discourage over-leveraging.
                - **Collateral Coverage Ratio (CCR)**: At **{token_results['Collateral Coverage Ratio']:.2f}**, the CCR reflects the system‚Äôs ability to remain sufficiently collateralized. A CCR below 1 indicates under-collateralization, which could precipitate forced liquidations or insolvency.
                - **Utilization Rate**: The system‚Äôs utilization rate is **{token_results['token_utilization'] * 100:.2f}%**, suggesting moderate liquidity availability. However, utilization above 80% may indicate stress, as high rates can strain liquidity during redemption or liquidation events.

                #### **Liquidation**
                The **Liquidation Threshold** for the system is **\${token_results['Liquidation Threshold (USD)']:,.2f}**, which serves as a critical point for collateral adequacy. Debt flagged for repayment currently totals **\${debt_to_unwind["debt_to_repay"]:,.2f}**, highlighting the importance of proactive rebalancing to prevent forced liquidations.
                
                #### Advanced Insights on Tokenomics
                - **Interest Rate Adjustments**: The base interest rate of 10%, modified by utilization and risk multipliers, provides a flexible framework. However, incorporating additional factors like collateral liquidity, token volatility, and macroeconomic indicators could enhance precision. Synthetic stablecoins such as sUSDe may justify lower rates due to perceived stability, while assets like weETH could require higher rates to account for staking-related risks;
                - **Correlation Risks**: Collateral assets with high correlation to each other or the broader market, such as weETH to ETH, pose systemic risks during downturns. Introducing a correlation-adjusted multiplier could mitigate the compounding effects of correlated price declines;
                - **Yield-Incentivized Debt Cycles**: For LRTs like weETH, staking yields can incentivize over-leveraging. Incorporating yield compression mechanisms into interest rate models could counterbalance this tendency and maintain systemic stability;
                - **Dynamic Leverage Caps**: Setting leverage limits based on historical price volatility and liquidity depth can prevent excessive risk accumulation during market booms, reducing the likelihood of cascading liquidations during corrections.

                #### **Recommendations for {token}**
                - **Maintain Robust Collateralization**: Ensure collateral remains above the MCR at all times to buffer against price fluctuations and market volatility. Synthetic stablecoins should be closely monitored for peg stability, while LRTs require additional safeguards for staking-related risks.
                - **Refine Interest Rate Models**: Adjust interest rates dynamically to incorporate market conditions, such as token-specific volatility, liquidity, and yield dynamics. Implement correlation-based risk adjustments to better reflect systemic exposures.
                - **Leverage and Utilization Management**: Set utilization thresholds below 80% to preserve liquidity and reduce stress during high-demand periods. Introduce dynamic leverage caps based on market conditions to curb excessive risk-taking.
                - **Regular Monitoring and Stress Testing**: Continuously stress-test the system under adverse scenarios, such as rapid price drops, peg devaluations, or mass liquidations. Use these tests to recalibrate risk multipliers and interest rate adjustments.
                - **Introduce Early Warning Mechanisms**: Implement on-chain or off-chain alerts to notify users when metrics like DCR, CCR, or utilization rates approach critical thresholds, enabling preemptive actions.

            #### **Collateralization and Stability**
            The system-wide **Safe Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR)**, currently averaging **{system_mcr:.2f}%**, provides an indication of the collateral safety net across supported tokens. 
            This ratio is designed to mitigate liquidation risks under normal conditions, but its adequacy can vary based on market volatility and token-specific risks.
            The **Total Collateral** in the system amounts to **\${system_total_collateral:,.2f}**, serving as the basis for ebUSD minting and trading. 
            While this figure suggests the current capacity of the system to support its operations, external factors such as sharp price fluctuations, over-minting, or high utilization could test its robustness. 
            A high total collateral base does not inherently guarantee system stability unless paired with effective risk management strategies.

            #### **Leverage, Liquidity, and Elasticity**
            The current **Leverage ratio** of **{system_leverage:.2f}x** reflects the system's efficiency in converting collateral into liquidity via ebUSD minting. 
            This measure balances capital efficiency with exposure to potential risks. However, higher leverage levels increase sensitivity to market downturns, where even minor adverse price movements can trigger cascading liquidation events.
            The **Liquidity-to-Debt Ratio**, standing at **{system_liquidity_to_debt_ratio:.2f}**, indicates the system's current capacity to handle redemptions and liquidations. 
            While this ratio suggests a degree of liquidity adequacy, sustained periods of high redemption activity or constrained liquidity could lead to stress in maintaining the peg.
            The **Liquidity Buffer**, valued at **\${liquidity_buffer:,.2f}**, is an important risk mitigation tool, absorbing volatility during periods of market stress. 
            However, the sufficiency of this buffer is conditional on external factors such as token utilization rates, price variability, and system-wide leverage.

            Elasticity metrics further underscore the system's adaptability:
            - **Borrower Demand Elasticity**: Interest rate adjustments play a role in balancing borrowing demand. Higher rates can curb excessive borrowing but may also discourage liquidity creation.
            - **Stability Pool Elasticity**: This reflects the system's ability to handle liquidations under fluctuating conditions of risk and demand, which can impact overall system resilience.

            #### **Risk Metrics and Depegging Risks**
            Key metrics highlight areas requiring attention:
            - **Slippage**: At **{slippage:.2f}%**, this metric reveals the sensitivity of the system to trading volumes and liquidity stress. Excessive slippage could destabilize ebUSD‚Äôs peg, especially under high-demand scenarios or constrained liquidity.
            - **Utilization Rates**: With average utilization at **{average_utilization * 100:.2f}%**, the system is operating at moderate capacity. However, utilization rates exceeding 80% typically indicate liquidity stress, requiring careful monitoring and potential interventions.
            - **Debt-to-Collateral Ratio (DCR)**: A DCR of **{system_debt_to_collateral_ratio:.2f}** suggests a controlled leverage environment at present. However, ratios exceeding 3x have historically been associated with heightened risks of systemic instability in similar systems.
            - **Total System Debt**: The system's total debt of **\${system_total_debt:,.2f}** highlights the scale of liabilities supported by collateral. While this is manageable under normal conditions, significant changes in collateral value or utilization could strain the system.

            The **Depegging Probability**, currently valued at **{depegging_probability}**, integrates these metrics into an overall risk signal. This assessment underscores the importance of monitoring slippage, utilization, and liquidity in tandem to preempt instability.

            #### **Redemption Fee Dynamics**

            Dynamic redemption fees offer a mechanism to stabilize the system under stress conditions. Linking fees to metrics such as Debt-to-Collateral Ratio (DCR) and utilization can discourage destabilizing redemptions. The proposed formula for dynamic redemption fees is:
            """)
            st.latex(r"""
            \text{Redemption Fee (\%)} = 3 \cdot \max(0, (\text{Debt-to-Collateral Ratio} - 0.9)) + 5 \cdot \max(0, (\text{Utilization} - 0.85))
            """)
            ("""
            This formula works as follows:
            - **Debt-to-Collateral Ratio (DCR) Threshold (\(0.9\))**: The threshold of \(0.9\) represents a hypothetical boundary for healthy system leverage. DCR values exceeding \(0.9\) suggest the system is nearing risky leverage levels. To discourage further redemptions under these conditions, the fee increases by **3%** for every unit the DCR exceeds this threshold. This ensures that users bear higher costs for redeeming in a high-leverage environment, reducing systemic risks.
            - **Utilization Threshold (\(0.85\))**: The threshold of \(0.85\) reflects the point at which liquidity constraints become critical. Utilization levels above \(85\%\) indicate that most available liquidity is in use, which could strain the system's ability to manage redemptions. For every unit of utilization above \(0.85\), the fee increases by **5%**, emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate liquidity.

            By applying these multipliers:
            - The multiplier of **3** for DCR highlights the importance of keeping leverage under control, but with a measured penalty to avoid overly discouraging redemptions when the DCR is marginally above the threshold.
            - The multiplier of **5** for utilization reflects the higher priority placed on preserving liquidity, as liquidity shortages pose more immediate risks to system stability.

            We thus ensure that higher DCR or utilization levels result in proportionally increased redemption fees, effectively discouraging excessive redemptions during periods of stress while protecting the system's peg and liquidity reserves. These parameters can be further refined through stress testing and historical data analysis to optimize system resilience.
            
            #### **Conclusions and Recommendations**
            To ensure the system remains resilient and adaptable:
            - **Maintain Collateralization Levels**: Monitor and manage collateral-to-debt ratios closely, adjusting MCR dynamically based on market conditions to cushion against price volatility.
            - **Strengthen Liquidity Buffers**: Expand the liquidity buffer during periods of low utilization to prepare for potential surges in redemption or liquidation demands.
            - **Monitor and React to Risk Indicators**: Utilize automated systems to track DCR, slippage, and utilization. Trigger proactive adjustments in interest rates or collateral requirements when metrics exceed thresholds.
            - **Implement Adaptive Redemption Fees**: Introduce fees that scale with system stress to mitigate destabilizing behaviors and maintain peg stability.
            - **Regular Stress Testing**: Conduct periodic stress tests to simulate adverse scenarios, ensuring preparedness for extreme market conditions and refining risk management strategies.
            - **Enhance System Elasticity**: Adjust interest rates and stability incentives to align with changing liquidity and risk dynamics, ensuring the system can respond flexibly to shifts in demand or collateral quality.
