                    To take the simplest scenario of the single-AVS restaking by operators [(Section 3.4.1 of EigenLayer's Whitepaper)](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/intro/whitepaper) to begin with: an AVS appears to be most secure when the amount of restaked ETH is at least double the total locked value (TVL) and a 50% quorum is required for a collusion attack to capture the TVL, as any successful attack would result in at least half of the attacker's stake being slashed. If the Total Restaked increases from there compared to the TVL, the risk gets reduced even further.

                    The **TVL/Total Restaked** logic is structured accordingly to desincentivize colluding operators to perform an attack: the greater the CfC (Cost from Corruption) is compared to the PfC (Profit from Corruption), the more secure the AVS is, and vice-versa. 

                    The **risk logic** herein is set so that the greater the *(AVS Total Restaked/2) : AVS TVL* ratio, the safer the AVS is, and vice-versa. If *AVS Total Restaked* and *AVS TVL* are both under $100K, we consider it the maximum risk scenario.

                    Understanding what a reduced risk level should be is not useful for operator-collusion cases only, but also for increasing the [CVS (Cost to Violate Safety) and the CVL (Cost to Violate Liveness)](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/dual-staking/), i.e. in a Dual Staking Model and Veto Dual Staking context, for example, which are useful to maintain the health of the AVS dual token pool (or AVS TVL, in other words).

Then thereâ€™s ***Dual Staking Utility***, with a high risk too because it depends on both ETH restakers and $AVS stakers, which introduces complexities in security and token value dynamics. The ***Tokenize the Fee*** model comes with moderate risk involving payments in a neutral denomination (like ETH) and distributing a portion of fees to holders of the AVS's token, thus partly dependent on the AVS token's value. Finally, ***Pure Wallet*** represents the lowest risk, relying on straightforward service fees paid in a neutral denomination, like ETH.

                Thus, the risk of each model is influenced by its reliance on the AVS's native token and the complexities of its fee and security structures.

                In designing modules for maximal security and minimal centralization risk, EigenLayer suggests two approaches: **Hyperscale and Lightweight AVS** [(Section 3.6 of EigenLayer's Whitepaper)](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/intro/whitepaper).

                **Hyperscale AVS** involves distributing the computational workload across many nodes, allowing for high overall throughput and reducing incentives for centralized validation. This horizontal scaling minimizes validation costs and amortization gains for any central operator. 

                On the other hand, the **Lightweight** approach focuses on tasks that are redundantly performed by all operators but are inexpensive and require minimal computing infrastructure.

                While it does depend on the needs of an AVS, the Hyperscale-type is more robust and secure due to its decentralized nature, particularly for new-born AVSs. Therefore, it was categorized as the safest AVS type in our simulator.

            The **AVS Risk Score** ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates the lowest level of risk and 10 represents the highest possible risk.
            
            The Risk Score is based on the risk level of each input category as well as their weighting, which is composed of their likelihood and impact. For example, the Likelihood of a X risk was considered higher than of the Y, and the Impact of X higher than Y. Both these variants were weighted per inpuit parameter. 
             
            We arrive at the final AVS Risk Score through a 0 to 10 normalization of the product of all the calculated risks per input.
